# Arlo code Project - WIP


This is an ambitious project aiming to make a coding agent that is:
- Long running capable in one command -> full with infra integration
- Cheaper to run same models vs other agents -> I think there is waste in how models are used
- Performs better on large codebases -> better code semantic understanding
- Support the vision of an agent companion and live team coding sessions
- Support hats for different types of work including teach, plan, long running, test, design and write
